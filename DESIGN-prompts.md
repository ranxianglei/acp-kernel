# Customizable Prompts — Design

Status: **Layers 0–1 shipped**. Layers 2–4 are design intent, not yet built.

## Goal

Let hosts (and eventually third parties) customize the prompt text acp-kernel
feeds to the model — without forking the kernel. The feature is staged so the
highest-leverage, lowest-risk surface opens first.

## Why it is delicate

Most of the kernel's prompt text is **load-bearing**: it was tuned over months of
production use to keep summaries lossless enough for retrieval. A summary that
drops the "KEEP VERBATIM file paths / signatures / decisions" guidance will
quietly lose the strings a later `decompress` or `grep` needs. So customization
must distinguish two classes of text:

| Class | Examples | Override risk |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Load-bearing** | the 4 compression rules (`COMPRESS_PHILOSOPHY`, `HOW_TO_COMPRESS_RULES`, `TIER2_DISTILL_RULES`, `TIER3_CONDENSE_RULES`) | High — degrades summary quality / retrieval |
| **Surface** | summary section header, status-report chrome, tool descriptions, nudge tone | Low — presentation only |

Load-bearing overrides require explicit risk acknowledgement; surface overrides
are free.

## Architecture: where prompts live

Prompts are split across two layers, and the override interface must keep them
consistent:

- **acp-kernel** owns the load-bearing rules as exported constants
  (`src/compression-rules.ts`) and the nudge renderer
  (`renderNudgeText` in `src/nudge-text.ts`) that embeds them. Crucially,
  `processTurn` returns a *structured* `NudgeDecision`, not text — the host
  renders it, so nudge wording is already host-controllable.
- **Adapters** (billion-context-pi, opencode-acp, …) own the system prompt and
  tool descriptions, and they inline the kernel's rule constants when composing
  them.

The `Prompts` interface is the single typed surface a host overrides once and
passes everywhere, so both layers render the same customized text.

## Layer 0 — kernel override interface (shipped)

Scope: open the 4 load-bearing rules for override, behind a risk gate. No
default wording changes; pure additive.

### Public API (`src/prompts.ts`)

```ts
export interface Prompts {
  compressPhilosophy: string;
  howToCompressRules: string;
  tier2DistillRules: string;
  tier3CondenseRules: string;
}

export const defaultPrompts: Prompts;            // == the verbatim rule constants

export function resolvePrompts(
  overrides?: Partial<Prompts>,
  options?: { acknowledgeRisk?: boolean },
): Prompts;
```

- `resolvePrompts()` returns the defaults.
- `resolvePrompts({ ... })` **throws** unless `{ acknowledgeRisk: true }` is
  passed, because every field is load-bearing. The error names the offending
  keys. This mirrors the existing `compress`-tool `dangerous` /
  `acknowledgeRisk` pattern.
- `renderNudgeText(decision, prompts = defaultPrompts)` now accepts a `Prompts`
  argument, so an override flows into every nudge tier (gentle / emergency /
  tier-2 / tier-3). The default keeps the one-arg call backward-compatible.

### Host usage

```ts
import { resolvePrompts, renderNudgeText } from "acp-kernel";

// once, at startup — throws if user overrides rules without ack
const prompts = resolvePrompts(userOverrides, { acknowledgeRisk: userAcked });

// pass to the kernel renderer
const nudge = renderNudgeText(decision, prompts);

// and to the adapter's own system-prompt composition (Layer 3 will formalize)
systemPrompt += prompts.compressPhilosophy + prompts.howToCompressRules;
```

### Non-goals for Layer 0

- Surface text (standing-prompt sections, tool descriptions, parameter
  descriptions) is **not** part of `Prompts` — it is covered by Layer 1
  (`src/surface-config.ts`) without a risk gate.
- Inline validation error strings (`src/compress.ts`) stay fixed.
- No config field is added to `Config` / `defaultConfig`; the host holds the
  resolved `Prompts` object and passes it explicitly. This keeps config purely
  numeric and avoids threading prompts through `processTurn`.

## Layer 1 — prompt/tool surface overrides (shipped)

Scope: open all *surface* text — standing-prompt sections, tool descriptions,
parameter descriptions — to free-form override. No risk gate: surface text is
presentation, and defaults stay byte-identical when no override is given
(regression-tested against 0.0.46 fixtures).

### Public API (`src/surface-config.ts`)

```ts
export type SectionOverride = string | null;

export type CompressPromptSections = {
  acpTags: SectionOverride;
  tools: SectionOverride;
  summariesInContext: SectionOverride;
  textProtocol: SectionOverride;
  textTools: SectionOverride;
  functionTools: SectionOverride;
};

export function applySectionOverrides(
  sections: ReadonlyArray<readonly [string, string]>,
  overrides?: Record<string, SectionOverride>,
): string[];

export function cloneWithDescriptions(
  schema: unknown,
  paramDescriptions: Record<string, string>,
): unknown;

export function applyAcpToolOverrides<T extends AcpToolLike>(
  tools: readonly T[],
  overrides?: ToolPrompts,
): T[];
```

- The three standing-prompt builders take an optional second argument:
  `buildCompressSystemPrompt(prompts?, sections?)` (same for the text/hybrid
  variants). Tri-state per section: `string` replaces the whole section
  (header + body), `null` removes it, omitted keeps the default. Keys that do
  not belong to a given builder are ignored.
- `cloneWithDescriptions` deep-clones a JSON tool schema and replaces the
  `description` of every property whose *name* matches, at any nesting depth.
  Names and structure are fixed — only human-readable text moves.
- `applyAcpToolOverrides` applies per-tool `description` + `paramDescriptions`
  to all three wire shapes (anthropic `input_schema`, openai
  `function.parameters`, responses flat `parameters`). Shared constants are
  never mutated.

### Consistency invariants

- Tool **names** are not customizable: nudge text and the kernel's own error
  messages hardcode `compress(...)` / `run acp_status`.
- The `acpTags` section must keep describing the actual tag format if the host
  relies on ref tags; replacing it with arbitrary text silently breaks tag
  awareness.

## Layer 2 — prompt-set format (design intent)

A portable, validated bundle so overrides are declarative rather than code:

```
acp-prompt-set.json   # { name, version, targetKernel, description, acknowledgeRisk }
philosophy.md          # overrides compressPhilosophy (omit to inherit default)
how-to-compress.md
tier2.md
tier3.md
```

Principles:
- **Partial override + inheritance** — a set specifies only what it changes;
  everything else inherits kernel defaults. Forward-compatible: a new kernel
  prompt field does not break existing sets.
- **JSON Schema validation** at load time.
- **`acknowledgeRisk` in the manifest** — load-bearing fields are still gated,
  so the set declares up front that it knowingly overrides quality-critical
  rules.

## Layer 3 — adapter plumbing (design intent)

Each adapter reads a prompt-set path from its config and feeds the resolved
`Prompts` to both the kernel renderer and its own system-prompt composition.

For billion-context-pi, `user-config.ts` (already reads `~/.pi/agent/acp.json`)
gains:

```json
{ "prompts": { "preset": "acp-prompt-pack-zen", "overrides": { "..." : "..." } } }
```

The same format works for every downstream (opencode-acp, omp-acp, …), so a
prompt set is portable across hosts.

## Layer 4 — third-party prompt packages (design intent)

Once the format is stable, a third party publishes an npm package exporting a
validated prompt set. Install + reference by name:

```
npm install acp-prompt-pack-zen
```

The kernel gains a `registerPromptSet` registry, matching the existing
`registerSearchAlgorithm` / `registerMessageFilter` pattern.

## Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Compression-quality regression from bad rules | `acknowledgeRisk` gate; defaults stay the strongly-recommended path |
| Version drift (kernel changes `NudgeDecision` shape) | `Prompts` is data-only (no function fields), so it is stable across refactors; future renderer overrides would carry a version stamp |
| Prompt injection via third-party packs | Prompt packs are trusted code (same trust level as any npm dep); documented in the trust model |
| Tool-description / schema mismatch | Tool schemas stay kernel-owned and fixed; only human-readable descriptions are customizable |

## Migration / rollout

1. Kernel ships Layers 0–1 (this PR). No downstream change required — defaults
   are byte-identical (fixture regression tests).
2. Adapters adopt the resolved-`Prompts` object plus the surface helpers when
   they want to offer customization (Layer 3), reading the same object for both
   nudge rendering and system-prompt composition.
3. Format + packages (Layers 2 & 4) follow once adoption confirms the field set
   is right.
